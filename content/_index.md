Welcome to beginning mapping and spatial analysis for social researchers course.
By the end of this course you will be able to:

- obtain spatial data,
- obtain suitable thematic data,
- spatially 'join' the data,
- produce a thematic map using appropriate software,
- export your thematic map,
- analyse and interpret it and explain the relationships between areas and themes

We will cover:

- spatial data (e.g. shapefiles, GeoJSON)
- thematic data (points (e.g. business locations); aggregate (e.g. population))
- 'joining' these data
- projections and coordinate reference systems (CRS)
- identifying, understanding, and describing spatial patterns
- exporting maps for reports or publications

To produce our maps we will use [QGIS](https://qgis.org/en/site/), a mature, open-source GIS [used extensively in academia, public organisations, and private companies](https://qgis.org/en/site/about/sponsorship.html).

# Venue

National Council for Voluntary Organisations, Society Building, 8 All Saints Street, London, N1 9RL


# Equipment

You will need your laptop to work through the exercises on the day.
If you have one, a mouse will be helpful.


# Software

Before the course please download the latest Long Term Release of QGIS, verion 3.4 'Madeira' for your platform.
This can be obtained from:

```html
https://www.qgis.org/en/site/forusers/download.html
```

You will also need a spreadsheet programme.
Microsoft Excel will be fine.
If you do not have a copy of this you can download LibreOffice for free from:

```html
https://www.libreoffice.org/download/download/
```

I recommend the long--term support version (currently 6.1), but either will be fine.

If you cannot get either software working on your device for whatever reason, download the `.exe` or `.dmg` for your system and I can help you on the day.


# Data

The venue has wifi so we will download much of the data as we go on the day (obtaining data is an important part of the process!).
However, if you could download and save a copy of the following `.zip` and bring it with you on the day this will give you access to the data you need in case there are any difficulties with the internet connection:

```

I look forward to meeting you on the 24th!
